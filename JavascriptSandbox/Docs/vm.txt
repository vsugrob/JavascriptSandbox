// Stack frame:
Stack frame is a structure containing pointers to current scope and registers.
{
	scope : RuntimeScope,
	registers : any
}
Its instance pushed to 'stack' upon entering into a function and popped upon exiting.
Program/function instructions must store their data in registers of the current frame.
User data should be stored/obtained to/from the current scope by using defVar (), setVar (), getVar ()
and related functionality of vm.
Absolutely no data should be stored in javascript variables when vm is between two instructions.
Adhering to these rules we get finite state machine that can be suspended/resumed at any time.
